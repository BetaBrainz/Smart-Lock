# Smart-Lock By Uvanesh B & Harrsh Nair
# Final Year Project

## **Introduction**
The Project reported here in and titled as “Smart Lock”. People want security in every place possible where they are i.e., their homes or away from their homes. An anti-theft system is a device or method used to prevent or deter unauthorized intrusion or trespassing activity in its coverage area. The implemented system was developed in combination of hardware and software. It's a unique security system made with low-cost wireless camera eras and sensors which ensures remote monitoring and control of doorways. The system empowered the user to monitor the doorway by capturing images using a high-performance wireless camera era i.e., ESP32-CAM connecting other devices and sensors in an IoT network. For other tasks like to control electronic door locks remotely, to click more pictures as well as to get notifications a cloud server application, ‘IFTTT’ was used. A major challenge was to develop this dynamic system with zero error, Realtime response and smooth performance, viable, smart, and feasible.
